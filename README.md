## ONE UI 5.1.1 BROKE EVERYTHING (EVERYTHING). DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU USE THIS MODULE. I'LL INVESTIGATE AND DO THE NECESSARY. IF YOU WANT TO UPDATE YOU MUST DISABLE THE MODULE SINCE IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE ON ONE UI 5.1.1

You can flash this Magisk module at your own risk. I am not responsible for lost warranty, bootloops, lost data, or any other damage to your device.

## Requiriments:
- Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 2020 (SM-P610 and SM-P615)
- Latest Magisk
- FWH2 or FWG4 firmware under OXM Multi-CSC (depending on model)
- Clean system (stock ROM, no modifications to stock ROM with magisk or other methods)
- 1GB of free storage (2GB recommended)
- Internet Connection (not necessary if using offline installer)

## Credits
These amazing features were created by Samsung and all APKs and libs in this module are official and signed by Samsung. None of this would have been possible if Samsung hadn't created these features.

## ⚠️ Uninstall/Disable and OS updates
Never disable this module because it may create big issues in the system. In this case install again the module, for example if you have booted in Safe Mode. Moreover, never update One UI/Android version (One Ui 5 -> 5.1, Android 12 -> 13) with module installed, uninstall the module before doing the update and then install again. 

## 💡Little tip

This module installs some big apps and libs. I suggest you to use Galaxy App Booster (Samsung official app of Good Guardians suite) after every big module update, so the tablet will not slow down. A "wipe cache" or "Repair apps" in Recovery may be useful in some cases. Moreover make sure all apps are up-to-date before/after installing this module (Play Store and Galaxy Store).
