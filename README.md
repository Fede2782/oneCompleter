Add missing One UI features to Tab S6 Lite and much more...

You can flash this Magisk module at your own risk. I am not responsible for lost warranty, bootloops, lost data, or any other damage to your device.

## Requirements:
- Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 2020 (SM-P610 and SM-P615)
- Latest Magisk with Zygisk enabled
- FWJ1 firmware under OXM Multi-CSC (depending on model)
- Clean system (stock ROM, no modifications to stock ROM with Magisk or other methods)
- 1GB of free storage (2GB recommended)
- Internet Connection (not necessary if using offline installer)

## Credits
These amazing features were created by Samsung. None of this would have been possible if Samsung hadn't created these features.

## 💡Little tip

This module installs some big apps and libs. I suggest you use Galaxy App Booster (Samsung official app of Good Guardians suite) after every big module update, so the tablet will not slow down. A "wipe cache" or "Repair apps" in Recovery may be useful in some cases. Moreover, make sure all apps are up-to-date before/after installing this module (Play Store and Galaxy Store).

## Features Now:
Since One UI 5.1.1, many features have been integrated with stock firmware and have been removed from oneCompleter for better stability. One UI 5.1.1 improved performance so this module has been lightened to keep One UI 5.1.1 running smoothly, however, no features have been removed.

*You still need a module to patch Samsung Health like [BlackMesa123's KnoxPatch](https://github.com/BlackMesa123/KnoxPatch/). Moreover, make sure Galaxy Store is not in Magisk denylist

## ⚠️ Uninstall/Disable and OS updates
Never disable this module because it may create big issues in the system. In this case, install again the module. If you have booted in Safe Mode you should reinstall it too. Never update One UI/Android version (One UI 5 -> 5.1, Android 12 -> 13) with the module installed, uninstall the module before doing the update and then install it again.
